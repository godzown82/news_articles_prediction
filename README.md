## Overview
The increase in fake news and misinformation has been an ongoing challenge in today’s digital age. Fake news impacts our lives heavily, for example, it can negatively influence democratic processes, public opinion, and decrease trust in institutions.  Limiting the spread of fake news is crucial; with truthful information, people are able to make informed decisions for themselves, and not be misled by incorrect information. 
Therefore, we created Truthseeker for our final project to combat the ongoing issue of misinformation. Truthseeker is an AI model that uses machine learning to both detect and counter misinformation. An AI is better equipped to combat misinformation, since manual fake checking by humans can be prone to bias and very time consuming.  

## Objective
As a passionate advocate for truth and accuracy in the digital age, we have developed TruthSeeker, an AI-powered tool designed to combat the spread of fake news. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques and a comprehensive dataset, TruthSeeker can accurately identify and flag fabricated news articles, helping individuals make informed decisions and contribute to a more trustworthy online environment.

## Conclusions and Future Development 
While we were developing our model we found some fake news articles were harder to distinguish from the truth than others. Some articles are not blatantly false, there is some truth. Articles such as these are harder to filter through. Thus, more information would need to be used when training our model to combat this issue. In addition, it would be helpful to add a feature that could explain to readers which information is not completely true, or information that has biased contents.  


**Plan for future development:** 
There are many applications in the future that can utilize fake news detection models. Truthseeker, along with other AI fake news detection models, can be applied to places like social media platforms. Studies have found that fake news is shared faster than truthful news. With fake political news being shared the most on these platforms. Having an AI flag these posts would prevent people from being misinformed. Unbiased and truthful information is critical to allowing people to make the best decisions for themselves. It is unjust to purposely mislead people for political gain. Since so many people visit social media platforms more readily than watching the news. It would be very important to ensure people are correctly informed.  
Journalism can also benefit from having AIs like Truthseeker so journalists can better identify fake articles and work to correct the information. This is so important since there is currently no comprehensive federal legislation in the U.S. specifically regulating deep fakes. Currently, congress is considering the following legislations: The Deepfake Report Act of 2019, requiring reports on digital content forgery, The DEEPFAKES Accountability Act, aiming to protect national security and provide recourse for deepfake victims, The DEFIANCE Act of 2024, focusing on non-consensual digital forgeries, The Protecting Consumers from Deceptive AI Act, which mandates standards for identifying AI-generated content. Individual states have also been working to combat misinformation. For example, the state of Texas criminalizes deceptive videos intended to influence elections. New Mexico and Indiana require disclaimers for deepfake content in election campaigns. Tennessee Updates personal rights protections to cover unauthorized use of likeness through AI.


Future development of our model would include A fake news being able to incorporate additional external sources, as well as work to investigate potential biases in the datasets where the information to build the model is pulled from. In addition, it would be more efficient if it was able to detect fake news sources in real time and have the ability to explain why the information is incorrect or misleading.
